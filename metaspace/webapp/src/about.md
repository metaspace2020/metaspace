## METASPACE is an open platform for metabolite imaging mass spectrometry

METASPACE platform hosts an engine for metabolite annotation of imaging mass spectrometry data
and stores the metabolites found in public datasets uploaded by users.

METASPACE platform is developed by the
[Alexandrov team at EMBL](http://www.embl.de/research/units/scb/alexandrov/) uniting analytical
and data scientists and reinforced by software engineers. This work is a part of the
[European project METASPACE](http://metaspace2020.eu).

## Open as public space

We do not hide anything. All code is open-source, the input format is the [imzML](http://imzml.org/)
supported by all mass spec major vendors. If you think we can do something better,
please [let us know](mailto:contact@metaspace2020.eu).

## How can I contribute?

Please read [our publication in Nature Methods](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v14/n1/full/nmeth.4072.html),
follow us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/metaspace2020), spread the word, and think of us while doing good deeds :)

Interested to contribute more?
- Are you a **mass spectrometrist** generating ultra-high resolution imaging mass spectrometry data? Please upload them; you will see, it is worth it
- Are a **software developer** or **computer scientist**? Check out our [GitHub](https://github.com/METASPACE2020)
- Are a **data scientist** interested to mine results from METASPACE? Please [contact us](mailto:contact@metaspace2020.eu) (export is around the corner)

For all other inquiries, please [contact us over email](mailto:contact@metaspace2020.eu).

## How shall I cite it in a publication?

Please cite our publication [(Palmer et al., 2016, Nature Methods)](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v14/n1/full/nmeth.4072.html),
