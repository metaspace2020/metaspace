## METASPACE provides an open platform for metabolite imaging mass spectrometry

METASPACE platform hosts an engine for metabolite annotation of imaging mass spectrometry data 
as well as a spatial metabolite knowledgebase of the metabolites from hundreds of public datasets 
provided by the community.

METASPACE platform is developed by software engineers, data scientists and mass spectrometrists
from the [Alexandrov team at EMBL](http://www.embl.de/research/units/scb/alexandrov/). 
This work is a part of the [European project METASPACE](http://metaspace2020.eu).

## Open as public space

We do not hide anything. All code is open-source, the input format is the [imzML](http://imzml.org/)
supported by all mass spec major vendors, the metabolite annotations from the community datasets are public
and can be browsed or exported.

## How can I contribute?

Please read [our publication in Nature Methods](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v14/n1/full/nmeth.4072.html),
follow us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/metaspace2020), spread the word, and think of us while doing good deeds :)

- **Have high-resolution imaging mass spectrometry data**? Please consider uploading them.
- **Are you a data scientist**? Please feel free to the export the metabolite annotations to mine thousands of metabolites found in hundreds of community-provided datasets.



## How shall I cite METASPACE in a publication?

Please cite our publication [(Palmer et al., 2016, Nature Methods)](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v14/n1/full/nmeth.4072.html) and refer to [http://annotate.metaspace2020.eu](http://annotate.metaspace2020.eu).

## Please appreciate those who funded it

Development of the METASPACE platform and releasing it for free to the community is only possible thanks 
to the support by the European Union’s Horizon2020 program under the grant agreement 634402.
