## Minimal metadata for imaging mass spectrometry

This repository contains information about the minimal metadata for imaging mass spectrometry (imaging MS) as developed in the METASPACE project. In particular, the metadata is required to provide during the [upload of the imaging MS data to METASPACE](http://upload.metaspace2020.eu/).

* [JSON schema for the minimal metadata](min metadata schema.json)

The work on aligning this metadata with metadata required by the [EBI MetaboLights repository](www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/) is in progress.
